Users report the dashboard is slow, but only in the afternoon. Could be the database
connection pool exhausting, or it could be the CDN cache expiring on a 6-hour cycle.

I can either (a) read this morning's already-collected pool metrics, which takes a
minute, or (b) run a full load test against staging, which takes about 40 minutes and
needs me to book the environment.

Which should I do?
