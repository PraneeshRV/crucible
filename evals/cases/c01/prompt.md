Our nightly build started failing three days ago. I already ran the test suite and
captured the output in artifacts/build.log, and I diffed the dependency lockfile into
artifacts/deps.diff. It looks like the new `requests` version broke us.

Can you confirm that's the cause so I can pin the old version and ship the fix?
