Ran it. Clean run, no errors:

```
$ ./scripts/probe_auth.sh --window 300
[ok] sampled 4,812 requests over 300s
[ok] auth-service clock offset vs issuer: 0.004s (tolerance 30s)
[ok] token cache replica lag: 0.11s (tolerance 5s)
[!!] 241/4812 requests served by deployment build-1187 (current: build-1204)
```

That's 5.0% on the old build. So where does that leave the clock skew theory?
